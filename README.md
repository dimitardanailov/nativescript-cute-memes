# A NativeScript-built iOS/Android app for building memes


## Development

This app was built with the [NativeScript CLI](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli). Once you have the [CLI installed](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli#installation), use the following commands to setup JustMeme:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-JustMeme.git
$ cd sample-JustMeme
$ tns platform add ios
$ tns platform add android
$ npm install
```

From there you're good to run the app on your device of choice. For instance the following runs the app on an iOS emulator:

```bash
$ tns run ios --emulator
```
